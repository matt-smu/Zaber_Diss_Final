So far we have reviewed an assortment of models, which describe the syntax and grammar of the system components we wish to analyze, along with metrics, which capture some property of security we wish to quantify. To measure a specific security property a metric is applied to an appropriate set of model instances. In theory this mapping is implicit in the metric's definition - a 

 Typically these security goals can be modeled in an attack graph using the attacker's intent and target objectives. We also take this opportunity to establish the notation used throughout the paper. Table \ref{tab:metric_summary} provides a brief summary of selected metrics.
