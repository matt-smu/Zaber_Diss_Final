The Cyber Security Analytics Framework illustrates a specific example of how an analytics pipeline can be formed from the composition of existing and newly created metrics. In Chapter \ref{ch:automation} we generalize this process as a 4-stage pipeline and show how this can be used to evaluate arbitrary sets of metrics against each other or against different inputs for validation, similarity scoring, and benchmarking. In this section we have explored the theoretical foundations of many of the model based metrics described Section \ref{sec:background:metrics} by defining
