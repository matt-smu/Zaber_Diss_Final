Time based metrics are a subset of probabilistic measures used to estimate how long it will take for some target objective to be met \cite{Dacier_Deswarte_Kaaniche}\cite{Ortalo_1999}\cite{McQueen_Boyer_Flynn_Beitel_2006}. 

\textbf{Mean Time To Failure (MTTF)} 

MTTF is the measure of the mean time for an attacker to reach a target. This measure directly maps to Expected Path Length as we have defined it above. 

\textbf{Mean Time To Breach (MTTB)} 

MTTB is the measure of the mean time for an attacker to reach a target. 

\textbf{Mean Time To Failure (MTTR)} 

MTTR is the measure of the mean time for an attacker to reach a target.
