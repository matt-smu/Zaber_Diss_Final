While the existing approaches to security analytics we have examined all enhance visibility into a system's security posture, to our knowledge there is no framework that provides a way to link these disparate processing steps without some amount of user interaction. In this section we identify areas in the CSAF pipeline that can benefit from automation and provide our solutions towards streamlining the process for real time systems security monitoring.% We also discuss the extensions needed to apply existing enterprise security monitoring models to include core networking infrastructure elements.
