% Before drawing any conclusions from the analysis, it should be reiterated that the results obtained rely on representative threat estimates. Refinement and feedback from an Information Assurance (IA) Officer familiar with these network architectures are needed to ensure the accuracy of the models.    

The results in this section demonstrate how comparison between architectures can be accomplished empirically using the security metrics presented in Section \ref{subsec:background:metrics}. Initial parameters did not produce attack graphs for the final state model. The implication is that this architecture was 'secure' given the identified vulnerabilities, attacker origin, and target. 

To continue our analysis we conducted 'what-if' testing by introducing hypothetical vulnerabilities into the models to represent as yet unknown attacks against specific infrastructure services and devices. Testing automation allowed us to run and collect results from 20 competing models during this stage of the analysis.
