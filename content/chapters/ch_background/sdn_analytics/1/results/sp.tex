Our findings from the structural algorithms for the three network models under test can be found in Table \ref{tab:sp_results}. The shortest path metric is a measure of the path of least resistance from an attacker's origin to the target, and can be considered a priority when identifying risk in a network. %Theoretically, it could also be used by an attacker to identify the most direct route to a target. Another consideration is that an attacker may want to determine shortest paths as part of a minimal cut set algorithm for efficiently intercepting or degrading the targetâ€™s communications.
