% \subsection{Motivation} 
The life cycle of large scale legacy infrastructure poses a unique security challenge to established organisations. Over time, assets age and get replaced, existing systems are bolted on through mergers and acquisitions, divisions may offload operations to the cloud, or sweeping regulations compliance may be mandated. As a system evolves it becomes increasingly difficult to manage updates atomically, and rolling upgrades are applied incrementally instead. These transition phases can invalidate security controls in subtle ways and leave the system vulnerable to attack. Our goal in this work is to surface these vulnerabilities during migration planning so they can be avoided or mitigated proactively.

The landscape of existing research related to graph based system security analysis is summarized here to provide the core concepts that support our efforts. We review the principals of network security analysis using attack graphs including derivation and representation, and present relevant security metrics from the literature using consistent language and naming which we will refer to in the following sections.
