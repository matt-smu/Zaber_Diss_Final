We present an improved approach to evaluating systems security during network planning using a suite of stochastic and analytic metrics to compare competing migration strategies. Large enterprises with sprawling infrastructure require an incremental approach to rolling out upgrades, but phased transitions can produce unintended configurations that affect system security. This paper addresses transitional security analysis by developing a framework and planning tool that expressively models infrastructure migration approaches and yields comparative security metrics to inform operations and architecture decision makers. Our use case to demonstrate the framework is a global carrier network migrating from decentralized, proprietary infrastructure to a centrally managed software defined network running on commodity hardware.
