NIST 800-55\cite{Swanson_Bartol_Sabato_Hash_Graffo_2003} describes security metrics as "\textit{tools designed to facilitate decision making and improve performance and accountability through collection, analysis, and reporting of relevant performance-related data. IT security metrics must be based on IT security performance goals and objectives.}" This section reviews some of the available security metrics from the literature loosely grouped by each Cybok heading, along with properties that have been used to characterize these metrics.
