% Embeddings - Words, Nodes, and Graphs to Vec

For a graph $G=(V,E)$, a node embedding function $f:u\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n$ maps each node $u \in G$ onto a $d$ dimensional set of real values called a feature vector. For any two nodes $u,v\in G$, a similarity function $sim(u,v)$ measures the strength of the relationship between the two nodes. Because nodes can be related in many different ways, there are multiple ways to measure similarity. The proximity of the encoded nodes in the embedding space reflects the similarity of the nodes in the original graph. Current embedding approaches include matrix factorization\cite{belkin2002laplacian}\cite{ahmed2013distributed}, random walks\cite{perozzi2014deepwalk}\cite{grover2016node2vec} and deep learning\cite{wang2016structural}\cite{kipf2016semi}
