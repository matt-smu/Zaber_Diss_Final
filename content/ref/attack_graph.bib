Instead, attack trees (ATs) and their improved ARMs can be used (e.g., Defense Trees, Protection Trees, Attack Response Trees, and Attack Countermeasure Trees), because they are a non-state-space model. However, there are no known methods to construct ATs in a scalable manner automatically while maintaining all possible attack scenarios. We can use an AG generation tools, and transform the AG into the AT using min-cuts. However, this method requires a transformation (i.e., an overhead), and computing min-cuts is a NP-hard problem. Another way is to construct ATs directly with given network information. A naive approach is to compute all possible attack paths and populate the AT branches using logic gates (e.g., AND and OR gates), but this method generates an exponential number of nodes, causing a scalability problem. We propose two logic reduction techniques to automate the ATs construction and to reduce the size of the AT. The computational complexity is calculated. The simulation result shows the construction time for the naive method and two logic reduction techniques. The trade-off between the construction time and the memory usage of simplified ATs are also shown.}

	abstractnote = {Software-Deﬁned Networking (SDN) has emerged as a framework for centralized command and control in cloud data centric environments. SDN separates data and control plane, which provides network administrator better visibility and policy enforcement capability compared to traditional networks. The SDN controller can assess reachability information of all the hosts in a network. There are many critical assets in a network which can be compromised by a malicious attacker through a multistage attack. Thus we make use of centralized controller to assess the security state of the entire network and pro-actively perform attack analysis and countermeasure selection. This approach is also known as Moving Target Defense (MTD). We use the SDN controller to assess the attack scenarios through scalable Attack Graphs (AG) and select necessary countermeasures to perform network reconﬁguration to counter network attacks. Moreover, our framework has a comprehensive conﬂict detection and resolution module that ensures that no two ﬂow rules in a distributed SDN-based cloud environment have conﬂicts at any layer; thereby assuring consistent conﬂict-free policy implementation and preventing information leakage.}

The extensions evaluated in this effort have been shown to be both technically valid given the capabilities of logic-based programming and appropriate given the current model data representations. The primary extensions researched as part of this work are: improved representation of network path constructs and assignment of value to data assets in the model.

However there exist more than 30 DAG-based methodologies, each having diﬀerent features and goals. The objective of this survey is to present a complete overview of graphical attack and defense modeling techniques based on DAGs. This consists of summarizing the existing methodologies, comparing their features and proposing a taxonomy of the described formalisms.

MulVAL is a framework to generate an attack graph for analysis of a computer network security risk. In MulVAL, it is assumed that the probability of success in exploiting the machine configuration and vulnerability variable is 100, and the vulnerability variables are independent of each other. In reality each machine has its own security configuration issue, and vulnerabilities are not independent of each other. Moreover the research in MulVAL attack graph solely focuses on the probability of vulnerability, whereas the probability of vulnerability in security configuration is not covered. In this paper we introduce three methods to improve the MulVAL framework. In the first method we employ Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) for calculating the probability of vulnerability variables, and Common Configuration Scoring System (CCSS) for calculating the probability of vulnerability of system security configuration. In the second method we introduce the interdependence of vulnerability variables in Bayesian senses. Finally, in the third method we analyze the impact of the change in system security configuration to the probability of vulnerability in the context of Bayesian probability. We analyze and discuss the proposed methods through a simulation for a simple network configuration. The simulation results of the proposed methods demonstrate that the introduction of CVSS, CCSS, employing dependency of vulnerability variables and system security configuration represent a more realistic model for vulnerability in MulVAL framework. © 2015, School of Electrical Engineering and Informatics.

	abstractnote = {Modern-day attackers tend to use sophisticated multi-stage/multi-host attack techniques and anti-forensics tools to cover their attack traces. Due to the limitations of current intrusion detection and forensic analysis tools, reconstructing attack scenarios from evidence left behind by the attackers of an enterprise system is challenging. In particular, reconstructing attack scenarios by using intrusion detection system (IDS) alerts and system logs that have too many false positives is a big challenge. In this paper, we present a model and an accompanying software tool that systematically addresses how to resolve the above problems to reconstruct attack scenarios that could stand up in court. These problems include a large amount of data including non-relevant data, missing evidence and incomplete evidence destroyed by using anti-forensic techniques. Our system is based on a Prolog system using known vulnerability databases and an anti-forensic database that we plan to extend to a standardized database like the existing NIST National Vulnerability Database (NVD). In this model, we use diﬀerent methods, including mapping the evidence to system vulnerabilities, inductive reasoning and abductive reasoning, to reconstruct attack scenarios. The goal of this work is to reduce the security investigators’ time and eﬀort in reaching deﬁnite conclusion about how an attack occurred. Our results indicate that such a reasoning system can be useful for network forensics analysis.}

So far, the research in Internet security primarily focused on. securing the information rather than securing the infrastructure itself. Given the prevailing threat situation, there is a compelling need to develop architectures, algorithms, and protocols to realize a dependable Internet infrastructure. In order to achieve this goal, the first and foremost step is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the security threats and existing solutions. This article attempts to fulfill this important step by providing a taxonomy of security attacks, which are classified into four main categories: DNS hacking, routing table poisoning, packet mistreatment, and denial-of-service attacks. The article discusses the existing solutions for each of these categories, and also outlines a methodology for developing secure protocols.}

	abstractnote = {An attack graph is a method used to enumerate the possible paths that an attacker can execute in the organization network. MulVAL is a known open-source framework used to automatically generate attack graphs. MulVAL’s default modeling has two main shortcomings. First, it lacks the representation of network protocol vulnerabilities, and thus it cannot be used to model common network attacks such as ARP poisoning, DNS spoofing, and SYN flooding. Second, it does not support advanced types of communication such as wireless and bus communication, and thus it cannot be used to model cyber-attacks on networks that include IoT devices or industrial components. In this paper, we present an extended network security model for MulVAL that: (1) considers the physical network topology, (2) supports short-range communication protocols (e.g., Bluetooth), (3) models vulnerabilities in the design of network protocols, and (4) models specific industrial communication architectures. Using the proposed extensions, we were able to model multiple attack techniques including: spoofing, man-in-the-middle, and denial of service, as well as attacks on advanced types of communication. We demonstrate the proposed model on a testbed implementing a simplified network architecture comprised of both IT and industrial components.}

These graphs are used to assess risk and to determine components that, when hardened, contribute most to risk reduction. While these graphs are powerful and widely used in enterprise network systems they focus on application vulnerabilities; they currently do not incorporate weaknesses in the network backbone (e.g., routing) that could lead to traffic hijacking, spoofing, eavesdropping, and several others. In this paper, we describe our work in augmenting the MulVAL attack graph software to incorporate network layer misconfigurations. Through a case study, we show how our modular data pipeline, leveraging previous work in network layer attack impact prediction, can aid system stakeholders in identifying risk and deciding on risk reduction strategies.}

Our metrics are grouped into families, with family-level metrics combined into an overall metric for network vulnerability risk. The Victimization family measures risk in terms of key attributes of risk across all known network vulnerabilities. The Size family is an indication of the relative size of the attack graph. The Containment family measures risk in terms of minimizing vulnerability exposure across protection boundaries. The Topology family measures risk through graph theoretic properties (connectivity, cycles, and depth) of the attack graph. We display these metrics (at the individual, family, and overall levels) in interactive visualizations, showing multiple metrics trends over time.}

The overall security of a network cannot be determined by simply counting the number of vulnerabilities. To accurately assess the security of networked systems, one must understand how vulnerabilities can be combined to stage an attack. We model such composition of vulnerabilities through attack graphs. By simulating incremental network penetration, and propagating attack likelihoods, we measure the overall security of a networked system. From this, we score risk mitigation options in terms of maximizing security and minimizing cost. We populate our attack graph models from live network scans and databases that have knowledge about properties such as vulnerability likelihood, impact, severity, and ease of exploitation. Our ﬂexible model can be used to quantify overall security of networked systems, and to study cost/beneﬁt tradeoﬀs for analyzing return on security investment.}

Usually, a cyber range simulates one or more critical infrastructures that attacking (red) and defending (blue) teams must compromise and protect, respectively. The infrastructure can be physically assembled, but much more convenient is to rely on the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) paradigm. Although some modern technologies support the IaaS, the design and deployment of scenarios of interest is mostly a manual operation. As a consequence, it is a common practice to have a cyber range hosting few (sometimes only one), consolidated scenarios. However, reusing the same scenario may signiﬁcantly reduce the effectiveness of the training and testing sessions.}
