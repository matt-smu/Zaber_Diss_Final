	abstractnote = {To trust a computer system that is supposed to be secure, it is necessary to predict the degree to which the system's security level can be achieved when operating in a specific environment under cyber attacks. In this paper, we propose a state-based stochastic model for obtaining quantitative security metrics representing the level of a system's security. The main focus of the study is on how to model the progression of an attack process over time. The basic assumption of our model is that the time parameter plays the essential role in capturing the nature of an attack process. In practice, the attack process will terminate successfully, possibly after a number of unsuccessful attempts. What is important is, indeed, the estimation of how long it takes to be conducted. The proposed stochastic model is parameterized based on a suitable definition of time distributions describing attacker's actions and system's reactions over time. For this purpose, probability distribution functions are defined and assigned to transitions of the model for characterizing the temporal aspects of the attacker and system behavior. With the definition of the distributions, the stochastic model will be recognized to be a semi-Markov chain. This mathematical model will be analytically solved to calculate the desirable quantitative security metrics, such as mean time to security failure and steady-state security. The proposed method shows a systematic development of the stochastic modeling techniques and concepts, used frequently in the area of dependability evaluation, for attack process modeling. Like any other modeling method, the proposed model is also constructed based on some underlying assumptions, which are specific to the context of security analysis.},

It describes a new framework for developing security metrics that focuses on effectiveness measures while maintaining measures of correctness. It introduces a view of security as a theoretical concept which encapsulates multiple aspects of a system. Viewing security as a theoretical attribute construct promotes the recognition that multiple characteristics and features of a system are required to make it secure. The view also motivates a sharp focus on system aspects which exhibit a measurable security attribute. The framework is illustrated with a case study.}

	abstractnote = {Security administration is an uphill task to implement in an enterprise network providing secured corporate services. With the slew of patches being released by Microsoft, HP and other vendors, system administrators require a barrage of tools for analyzing the risk due to these vulnerabilities. In addition to this, criticalities in patching some end hosts (e.g., in hospitals) raises serious security issues about the network to which the end hosts are connected. In this context, it would be imperative to know the risk level of all critical resources (e.g., Oracle Server in HR department) keeping in view the everyday emerging new vulnerabilities. We hypothesize that sequence of network actions by an attacker depends on the social behavior (e.g., skill level, tenacity, financial ability). By verifying our hypothesis on hacker email communications, we extended this methodology and calculated risk level for a small network. Towards this goal, we formulated a mechanism to estimate the risk level of critical resources that may be compromised based on attacker behavior. This estimation is accomplished using behavior based attack graphs. These graphs represent all the possible attack paths to all the critical resources. Based on these graphs, we calculate the risk level of a critical resource using Bayesian methodology and periodically update the subjective beliefs about the occurrence of an attack. Such a calculated risk level would be a measure of the vulnerability of the resource and it forms an effective basis for a system administrator to perform suitable changes to network configuration. Thus suitable vulnerability analysis and risk management strategies can be formulated to efficiently curtail the risk from different types of attacker (script kiddies, hackers, criminals and insiders).}

	abstractnote = {Quantifying security risk is an important and yet difficult task in enterprise network security management. While metrics exist for individual software vulnerabilities, there is currently no standard way of aggregating such metrics. We present a model that can be used to aggregate vulnerability metrics in an enterprise network, producing quantitative metrics that measure the likelihood breaches can occur within a given network configuration. A clear semantic model for this aggregation is an important first step toward a comprehensive network security metric model. We utilize existing work in attack graphs and apply probabilistic reasoning to produce an aggregation that has clear semantics and sound computation. We ensure that shared dependencies between attack paths have a proportional effect on the final calculation. We correctly reason over cycles, ensuring that privileges are evaluated without any self-referencing effect. We introduce additional modeling artifacts in our probabilistic graphical model to capture and account for hidden correlations among exploit steps. The paper shows that a clear semantic model for aggregation is critical in interpreting the results, calibrating the metric model, and explaining insights gained from empirical evaluation. Our approach has been rigorously evaluated using a number of network models, as well as data from production systems.}

You'll discover how to quantify hard-to-measure security activities, compile and analyze all relevant data, identify strengths and weaknesses, set cost-effective priorities for improvement, and craft compelling messages for senior management.     Security Metrics successfully bridges management's quantitative viewpoint with the nuts-and-bolts approach typically taken by security professionals. It brings together expert solutions drawn from Jaquith's extensive consulting work in the software, aerospace, and financial services industries, including new metrics presented nowhere else. You'll learn how to:   \textbullet{} Replace nonstop crisis response with a systematic approach to security improvement \textbullet{} Understand the differences between ``good'' and ``bad'' metrics \textbullet{} Measure coverage and control, vulnerability management, password quality, patch latency, benchmark scoring, and business-adjusted risk \textbullet{} Quantify the effectiveness of security acquisition, implementation, and other program activities  \textbullet{} Organize, aggregate, and analyze your data to bring out key insights \textbullet{} Use visualization to understand and communicate security issues more clearly  \textbullet{} Capture valuable data from firewalls and antivirus logs, third-party auditor reports, and other resources \textbullet{} Implement balanced scorecards that present compact, holistic views of organizational security effectiveness}

The probability for successful attacks during the learning and innovative phases is expected to be small, although for different reasons. During the standard attack phase it is expected to be considerably higher.}

For day-to-day operation, security officers and administrators need an effective response (or decision aid) system to handle ongoing cyberattacks. Effective countermeasures must minimize the risks induced by these attacks, noting that the risk is evaluated as a function of the success likelihood and the impact of an attack. In this paper, we demonstrate how to dynamically calculate the success likelihood (SL) for an ongoing attack by considering the progress of an attacker towards his objective. Afterwards, we present a response/decision aid system based on the SL metric. Finally, we present the Success Likelihood Assessment Module (SLAM), which implements and highlights the relevance of our work for real time security management. This paper focuses on the operational aspects of a security by design approach. \textcopyright{} 2012 Alcatel-Lucent.}

	abstractnote = {Traditional security analyses are often geared toward cryptographic primitives or protocols. Although such analyses are necessary, they cannot address a defender's need for insight into which aspects of a networked system having a significant impact on its security, and how to tune its configurations or parameters so as to improve security. This question is known to be notoriously difficult to answer, and the state of the art is that we know little about it. Toward ultimately addressing this question, this paper presents a stochastic model for quantifying security of networked systems. The resulting model captures two aspects of a networked system: 1. the strength of deployed security mechanisms such as intrusion detection systems and 2. the underlying vulnerability graph, which reflects how attacks may proceed. The resulting model brings the following insights: 1. How should a defender tune system configurations (e.g., network topology) so as to improve security? 2).How should a defender ``tune'' system parameters (e.g., by upgrading which security mechanisms) so as to improve security? 3. Under what conditions is the steady-state number of compromised entities of interest below a given threshold with a high probability? Simulation studies are conducted to confirm the analytic results, and to show the tightness of the bounds of certain important metric that cannot be resolved analytically.}

The taxonomy is intended to be a step on the road to an established taxonomy of intrusions for use in incident reporting, statistics, warning bulletins, intrusion detection systems etc. Unlike previous schemes, it takes the viewpoint of the system owner and should therefore be suitable to a wider community than that of system developers and vendors only. It is based on data from a realistic intrusion experiment, a fact that supports the practical applicability of the scheme. The paper also discusses general aspects of classification, and introduces a concept called dimension. After having made a broad survey of previous work in the field, we decided to base our classification of intrusion techniques on a scheme proposed by Neumann and Parker in 1989 and to further refine relevant parts of their scheme. Our classification of intrusion results is derived from the traditional three aspects of computer security: confidentiality, availability and integrity.}

	abstractnote = {Ideally, a measure of the security of a system should capture quantitatively the intuitive notion of `the ability of the system to resist attack'. That is, it should be operational, reflecting the degree to which the system can be expected to remain free of security breaches under particular conditions of operation (including attack). Instead, current security levels at best merely reflect the extensiveness of safeguards introduced during the design and development of a system. Whilst we might expect a system developed to a higher level than another to exhibit `more secure behaviour' in operation, this cannot be guaranteed; more particularly, we cannot infer what the actual security behaviour will be from knowledge of such a level. In the paper we discuss similarities between reliability and security with the intention of working towards measures of `operational security' similar to those that we have for reliability of systems. Very informally, these measures could involve expressions such as the rate of occurrence of security breaches (cf rate of occurrence of failures in reliability), or the probability that a specified `mission' can be accomplished without a security breach (cf reliability function). This new approach is based on the analogy between system failure and security breach. A number of other analogies to support this view are introduced. We examine this duality critically, and have identified a number of important open questions that need to be answered before this quantitative approach can be taken further. The work described here is therefore somewhat tentative, and one of our major intentions is to invite discussion about the plausibility and feasibility of this new approach.}

Researchers have proposed a variety of methods to build attack trees with chains of exploits, based on which post-graph vulnerability analysis can be performed. The most recent approaches attempt to build attack trees by enumerating all potential attack paths, which are space consuming and result in poor scalability. This paper presents an approach to use Bayesian network to model potential attack paths. We call such graph as ``Bayesian attack graph''. It provides a more compact representation of attack paths than conventional methods. Bayesian inference methods can be conveniently used for probabilistic analysis. In particular, we use the Bucket Elimination algorithm for belief updating, and we use Maximum Probability Explanation algorithm to compute an optimal subset of attack paths relative to prior knowledge on attackers and attack mechanisms. We tested our model on an experimental network. Test results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.}

The proposed methodology employs a directed graph called a compromise graph, where the nodes represent stages of a potential attack and the edges represent the expected time-tocompromise for differing attacker skill levels. Timeto-compromise is modeled as a function of known vulnerabilities and attacker skill level. The methodology was used to calculate risk reduction estimates for a specific SCADA system and for a specific set of control system security remedial actions. Despite an 86\% reduction in the total number of vulnerabilities, the estimated time-to-compromise was increased only by about 3 to 30\% depending on target and attacker skill level.}

A wide array of model-based evaluation techniques is now available, ranging from combinatorial methods, which are useful for quick, rough-cut analyses, to state-based methods, such as Markov reward models, and detailed, discrete-event simulation. The use of quantitative techniques for security evaluation is much less common, and has typically taken the form of formal analysis of small parts of an overall design, or experimental red team-based approaches. Alone, neither of these approaches is fully satisfactory, and we argue that there is much to be gained through the development of a sound model-based methodology for quantifying the security one can expect from a particular design. In this work, we survey existing model-based techniques for evaluating system dependability, and summarize how they are now being extended to evaluate system security. We find that many techniques from dependability evaluation can be applied in the security domain, but that significant challenges remain, largely due to fundamental differences between the accidental nature of the faults commonly assumed in dependability evaluation, and the intentional, human nature of cyber attacks.}

The overall security of a network cannot be determined by simply counting the number of vulnerabilities. To accurately assess the security of networked systems, one must understand how vulnerabilities can be combined to stage an attack. We model such composition of vulnerabilities through attack graphs. By simulating incremental network penetration, and propagating attack likelihoods, we measure the overall security of a networked system. From this, we score risk mitigation options in terms of maximizing security and minimizing cost. We populate our attack graph models from live network scans and databases that have knowledge about properties such as vulnerability likelihood, impact, severity, and ease of exploitation. Our flexible model can be used to quantify overall security of networked systems, and to study cost/benefit tradeoffs for analyzing return on security investment.}

Since meaningful quantitative security metrics are largely unavailable, the security community primarily uses qualitative metrics for security. In this paper, we present a novel quantitative metric for the security of computer networks that is based on an analysis of attack graphs. The metric measures the security strength of a network in terms of the strength of the weakest adversary who can successfully penetrate the network. We present an algorithm that computes the minimal sets of required initial attributes for the weakest adversary to possess in order to successfully compromise a network; given a specific network configuration, set of known exploits, a specific goal state, and an attacker class (represented by a set of all initial attacker attributes). We also demonstrate, by example, that diverse network configurations are not always beneficial for network security in terms of penetrability.}

A detailed security analysis on an IEC61850 automated substation is peformed initially with a focus on the possible goals of the attacker. This is followed by the development of a scheme to audit the security of such a network. Security metrics are considered since they provide a tangible means of quantifying the security of a network. The proposed auditing scheme is tested by using it to audit the security of an IEC61850 network. The results are then compared with two other metric schemes-the mean time to compromise (MTTC) metric and the VEA-bility metric, which are used for auditing conventional computer networks. The input data for both metrics are obtained by using a network security tool to scan the IEDs of the network. The impact of using high-traffic generating network security tools on a time-critical IEC61850 network is also investigated.}

We surveyed the current state of the art in qualita-tive and quantitative security measurement to characterize the available measurement strategies, their maturity, and the conceptual or technical obstacles preventing further progress in this field of research. We classified the proposed security indicators with respect to their characteristic properties and derived a classification tree delineating the different security assessment strategies and their derived security measures. Based on this overview, we analyzed the relative merits and deficiencies of current approaches, and we suggested future steps towards better security metrics. This paper summarizes the main results of our survey.}

One of the unsolved problems of security engineering is the adoption of measures or metrics that can reliably depict the assurance associated with a specific hardware and software system. This paper reports on a recent attempt to focus requirements in this area by examining those currently in use. It then suggests a categorization of Information Assurance (IA) metrics that may be tailored to an organization's needs1. We believe that the provision of security mechanisms in systems is a subset of the systems engineering discipline having a large software-engineering correlation. There is general agreement that no single system metric or any ``one-prefect'' set of IA metrics applies across all systems or audiences. The set most useful for an organization largely depends on their IA goals, their technical, organizational and operational needs, and the financial, personnel, and technical resources that are available.}

Such quantified security has been presented as a general approach to precisely assess and control security. We classify a significant part of the work between 1981 and 2008 with respect to security perspective, target of quantification, underlying assumptions and type of validation. The result shows how the validity of most methods is still strikingly unclear. Despite applying a number of techniques from fields such as computer science, economics and reliability theory to the problem it is unclear what valid results exist with respect to operational security. Quantified security is thus a weak hypothesis because a lack of validation and comparison between such methods against empirical data. Furthermore, many assumptions in formal treatments are not empirically well-supported in operational security and have been adopted from other fields. A number of risks are present with depending on quantitative methods with limited or no validation.}

	abstractnote = {By enabling a direct comparison of different security solutions with respect to their relative effectiveness, a network security metric may provide quantiſable evidences to assist security practitioners in securing computer networks. However, research on security metrics has been hindered by difſculties in handling zero day attacks exploiting unknown vulnerabilities. In fact, the security risk of unknown vulnerabilities has been considered as something unmeasurable due to the less predictable nature of software ƀaws. This causes a major difſculty to security metrics, because a more secure conſguration would be of little value if it were equally susceptible to zero day attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel security metric, k-zero day safety, to address this issue. Instead of attempting to rank unknown vulnerabilities, our metric counts how many such vulnerabilities would be required for compromising network assets; a larger count implies more security since the likelihood of having more unknown vulnerabilities available, applicable, and exploitable all at the same time will be signiſcantly lower. We formally deſne the metric, analyze the complexity of computing the metric, devise heuristic algorithms for intractable cases, and ſnally demonstrate through case studies that applying the metric to existing network security practices may generate actionable knowledge.}

	abstractnote = {Diversity has long been regarded as a security mechanism for improving the resilience of software and networks against various attacks. More recently, diversity has found new applications in cloud computing security, Moving Target Defense (MTD), and improving the robustness of network routing. However, most existing efforts rely on intuitive and imprecise notions of diversity, and the few existing models of diversity are mostly designed for a single system running diverse software replicas or variants. At a higher abstraction level, as a global property of the entire network, diversity and its effect on security have received limited attention. In this paper, we take the first step towards formally modeling network diversity as a security metric by designing and evaluating a series of diversity metrics. Specifically, we first devise a biodiversity-inspired metric based on the effective number of distinct resources. We then propose two complementary diversity metrics, based on the least and the average attacking efforts, respectively. We provide guidelines for instantiating the proposed metrics and present a case study on estimating software diversity. Finally, we evaluate the proposed metrics through simulation.}
